# Phase 30: UI Enhancements

> **Status:** Not Started
> **Goal:** Transform step entry, add professional workflow features, polish visual feedback, and improve discoverability.

---

## 30A: Visual Feedback

### Progress Bar Above Grid

Display a thin progress indicator above the step grid showing playback position.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Height | 2-3px |
| Position | Above step grid, full width |
| Color | `--color-playhead` (white) |
| Behavior | Moves left-to-right during playback, resets on stop |

**Implementation:**
- Calculate position from current step / total steps (use longest track for reference)
- Smooth easing via CSS custom properties (`--progress-easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`)
- Hidden when stopped

**Polyrhythm behavior:**

Progress bar shows position relative to the **longest track**. Shorter tracks loop multiple times within one progress cycle.

| Longest Track | Progress Range | 5-step track loops |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 16 steps | 0% → 100% | 3× per cycle |
| 32 steps | 0% → 100% | 6× per cycle |

Individual track looping is already visible via step highlighting. The progress bar provides global orientation, not per-track precision.

**Optional enhancement:** Subtle pulse or marker when shorter tracks restart (low priority).

### Metronome Pulse on Play Button

Visual beat indicator on the play button during playback, synced to tempo.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Trigger | Every beat (quarter note), synced to BPM |
| Effect | Brief scale pulse (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.0) or opacity flash |
| Duration | Proportional to tempo (~100ms at 120 BPM) |
| Sync | Aligned to audio scheduler beat events |

**Implementation:**
- Subscribe to scheduler beat events
- CSS animation with duration derived from `--beat-duration` CSS variable
- Smooth easing: `--pulse-easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1)`
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

---

## 30B: Pattern Manipulation

Add pattern transformation tools to each track.

### Rotate Pattern Left/Right

Shift all active steps by one position, wrapping around.

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Rotate Left | Step 0 → Step 15, Step 1 → Step 0, etc. |
| Rotate Right | Step 15 → Step 0, Step 0 → Step 1, etc. |

**UI:** Arrow buttons (← →) in track actions or context menu.

### Invert Pattern

Toggle all steps: active becomes inactive, inactive becomes active.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `[X][ ][ ][X]` | `[ ][X][X][ ]` |

**UI:** Invert button (⊘ or similar) in track actions.

### Reverse Pattern

Play the pattern backwards. Instant new groove from existing work.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `[X][ ][X][ ][ ][ ][ ][X]` | `[X][ ][ ][ ][ ][X][ ][X]` |

**UI:** Reverse button (⇆) in track actions.

### Mirror Pattern

Create ABCDCBA structure from ABCD. Musical symmetry that sounds intentional.

| Before (ABCD) | After (ABCDCBA) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `[X][ ][X][X]` | `[X][ ][X][X][X][ ][X]` (if space allows) |

**Implementation:**
- Mirrors pattern within current step count
- First half defines pattern, second half mirrors it
- Useful for 8, 16, 32 step patterns

**UI:** Mirror button (◇) in track actions.

### Euclidean Rhythm Generator

Slider that distributes N hits across M steps mathematically. Bjorklund's algorithm creates rhythms found in world music (West African, Cuban, etc.).

| Steps | Hits | Pattern | Musical Style |
|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| 8 | 3 | `[X][ ][ ][X][ ][ ][X][ ]` | Cuban tresillo |
| 8 | 5 | `[X][ ][X][X][ ][X][X][ ]` | Cuban cinquillo |
| 16 | 5 | Distributed evenly | Bossa nova |

**UI:**
- "Fill" slider (1 to stepCount) on each track
- Dragging redistributes active steps using Euclidean algorithm
- Visual feedback is instant as slider moves

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Bjorklund's algorithm
function euclidean(steps: number, hits: number): boolean[] {
  // Returns array of length `steps` with `hits` trues distributed maximally evenly
}
```

---

## 30C: Information Display

### Category Color Coding on Tracks

Visual indication of instrument category via **left border** on each track row.

| Category | Color | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Drums/Percussion | Orange (`--color-accent`) | 808-kick, acoustic-snare |
| Bass | Purple (`--color-purple`) | finger-bass, sub-bass |
| Keys/Pads | Cyan (`--color-cyan`) | rhodes-ep, pad |
| Melodic | Teal (`--color-teal`) | vibraphone, marimba |
| Strings/Brass | Info blue (`--color-info`) | string-section, french-horn |
| FX/Ambient | Gray | vinyl-crackle, noise |

**Implementation:**
- 3-4px left border on track row
- Subtle enough not to distract, visible enough to aid scanning
- Category derived from instrument metadata in `samples.ts`

```css
.track-row[data-category="drums"] { border-left: 4px solid var(--color-accent); }
.track-row[data-category="bass"] { border-left: 4px solid var(--color-purple); }
/* etc. */
```

### Dim Unused Beat Markers

Reduce visual noise by dimming steps that are off.

| State | Opacity |
|-------|---------|
| Active step | 100% |
| Inactive step (in use area) | 60-70% |
| Inactive step (beyond track length) | 30-40% |

**Implementation:**
- CSS opacity on `.step-cell:not(.active)`
- Darker for steps beyond current track's `stepCount`

---

## 30D: Editing Conveniences

### Double-Click Track Name to Rename

Inline editing of track names.

| Interaction | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Double-click track name | Text input appears |
| Enter / blur | Save name |
| Escape | Cancel edit |

**Implementation:**
- `contentEditable` or controlled input overlay
- Dispatch `SET_TRACK_NAME` action
- Sync via multiplayer (`track_name` message type)
- Max length: 32 characters
- XSS prevention: sanitize on save

### Per-Track Swing

Individual swing amount per track, in addition to global swing.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0-100% (same as global) |
| Behavior | Combines with global swing multiplicatively |
| Default | 0% (uses global swing only) |

**Location:** In the Track Drawer (see 30I), alongside volume, transpose, step count, and playback mode.

**Use cases:**
- Straight hi-hats over swung kick/snare
- Tight bass with loose drums
- Different groove feels per instrument

### Click Track Name to Preview Sample

Single-click the track name to hear one hit of that instrument.

**Why:** "Which track is the snare?" Instead of soloing and playing, just click the name and hear it.

| Interaction | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Single-click track name | Preview sound plays immediately |
| Double-click track name | Rename (existing behavior) |

**Preview behavior:**

| Instrument Type | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| Percussion (kick, snare, hat) | Plays full sample with natural decay |
| Sustained (pad, strings, rhodes) | Plays ~300ms note, then releases |

**Audio routing:**
- Respects track volume (hear actual mix level)
- Goes through effects (hear actual sound in context)
- Plays immediately, not quantized to beat
- Works whether sequencer is playing or stopped

**Implementation:**
- 200ms delay after click to distinguish from double-click
- If no second click, trigger preview
- `engine.previewTrack(trackId, { pitch: 0, velocity: 1.0 })`

### Unmute All Button

Reset all tracks to unmuted in one click.

**Why:** You've muted 5 tracks to focus on the drums. Now you want to hear everything. Currently: click M five times. With this: one click.

**Location:** Transport bar, near global controls.

**Behavior:**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Unmute All** | Sets `muted: false` on all tracks |

**Visual:**
- Disabled/hidden when no tracks are muted
- Shows count: "Unmute All (3)" when 3 tracks muted

**Keyboard shortcut:** `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + M` (unmute all)

**Implementation:**
- `UNMUTE_ALL` action in reducer
- Multiplayer: batch message or individual `track_mute` messages

---

## 30E: Motion

### Play Button Fill Effect on Hover

Subtle fill animation on hover for play button.

| State | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Hover | Background fills from left to right |
| Press | Instant fill |
| Release | Fill drains or fades |

**Implementation:**
- CSS `::before` pseudo-element with `transform: scaleX(0)` → `scaleX(1)`
- Transition: 200-300ms ease-out
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

---

## 30F: Core Interaction Improvements

### Drag to Paint Steps

Step entry is the core activity. Currently it's click-click-click-click. Should be click-drag-release.

**Why:** This is how Ableton, FL Studio, and every hardware sequencer works. Makes step entry roughly 5x faster for typical patterns.

| Interaction | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Mouse down on step | Start paint mode, toggle that step |
| Mouse move (drag) | Toggle steps under cursor |
| Mouse up | End paint mode |

**Paint mode behavior:**
- First step clicked determines "paint state" (on or off)
- All subsequent steps in the drag get set to that state
- Prevents accidental toggling back and forth

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const [paintMode, setPaintMode] = useState<'on' | 'off' | null>(null);

onMouseDown={(step) => {
  const newState = !step.active;
  setPaintMode(newState ? 'on' : 'off');
  toggleStep(step);
}}

onMouseEnter={(step) => {
  if (paintMode !== null && step.active !== (paintMode === 'on')) {
    toggleStep(step);
  }
}}

onMouseUp={() => setPaintMode(null)}
```

**Touch support:**
- Same behavior with touch events
- Consider `pointer` events for unified handling

### Multi-Select Steps

Select multiple steps to delete, copy, move, or apply the same parameter lock.

**Why:** Currently every operation is one step at a time. This enables "select beats 1-8 of the hi-hat and copy to beats 9-16."

| Interaction | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Ctrl/Cmd + click | Start selection / toggle step (sets anchor) |
| Shift + click | Extend selection from anchor to clicked step |
| Click + drag | Draw selection box |
| Delete/Backspace | Clear selected steps |
| Ctrl/Cmd + C | Copy selection |
| Ctrl/Cmd + V | Paste at playhead or selection start |
| ESC | Clear selection |

**Note on Shift+Click:** When no selection exists, Shift+Click opens the p-lock menu (backward compatible). Once a selection is active, Shift+Click extends the selection. See "Modifier Key Conflict Resolution" in Testing & Implementation Strategy for full details.

**Visual:**
- Selection highlight (blue tint + thicker border)
- Selection count badge in transport bar: `░░ 3 selected (ESC) ░░`
- Anchor step indicator (▲) showing extend-from point

**Operations on selection:**
- Clear all
- Apply p-lock (velocity, pitch, **tie**) to all
- Copy to clipboard (for paste)
- Move (drag selection to new position)

**Tie/Held Note Support:**
- Selection includes tie state — copying preserves ties
- "Apply tie to selection" creates legato phrase across selected steps
- "Remove tie from selection" articulates each step separately
- Enables quick creation of held note passages

**Polyrhythm behavior:**
- Cross-track selection bounded by each track's step count
- Selecting "columns 1-8" on a 5-step track selects steps 1-5 only
- Operations apply to the intersection of selection and actual steps

---

## 30G: Workflow Features

### Loop Selection (Play Only Selected Region)

"Just play steps 17-32 while I work on them."

**Why:** Currently you hear the entire pattern every time. For 64-128 step patterns, this means waiting through 50+ steps to hear your change.

| Interaction | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Drag on timeline ruler | Select loop region (in steps) |
| Shift + click two points | Define loop start/end |
| Double-click ruler | Clear loop (play all) |

**Visual:**
- Timeline ruler above grid (can combine with progress bar)
- Loop region highlighted
- Loop markers (brackets or flags)
- Steps outside loop are dimmed

**Behavior:**
- Playhead bounces between loop start and end
- Loop persists until cleared

**Polyrhythm behavior:**

Loop selection defines a **global step range**. All tracks play within that range, looping as they normally would.

| Loop Setting | 16-step track | 5-step track | 4-step track |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Steps 1-16 | Plays once | Loops 3× | Loops 4× |
| Steps 8-16 | Plays steps 8-16 | Loops normally within window | Loops 2× within window |

The loop constrains the **global playhead position**, not individual track positions. Shorter tracks continue their polyrhythmic looping within the selected region.

### Track Reorder (Drag and Drop)

Organize tracks visually: all drums together, bass below, melodic at bottom.

**Why:** You add tracks in the order you think of them. But you want to see them organized. This is such a basic expectation that its absence is jarring.

| Interaction | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Drag track handle | Track follows cursor |
| Drop between tracks | Track moves to new position |
| Drop indicator | Line shows insertion point |

**Implementation:**
- Drag handle on left of track row (☰ or grip dots)
- `REORDER_TRACKS` action with `fromIndex`, `toIndex`
- Multiplayer sync: `track_reorder` message
- CSS transitions for smooth reflow

### Velocity Lane (Visual Velocity Editing)

Parameter locks exist for velocity, but they're buried in a menu per step.

**Why:** Every professional sequencer shows velocity as vertical bars below each track that you can drag to adjust. Transforms dynamics from "tedious" to "visual sculpting."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Display | Vertical bars below each step (height = velocity) |
| Edit | Drag bar top to adjust velocity |
| Default | 100% (full height) |
| Range | 0-127 (MIDI standard) or 0-100% |

**Visibility:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Default state | **Hidden** |
| Toggle | Per-track button (📊 or ▾) |
| Desktop | Both velocity lane and ChromaticGrid can be open simultaneously |
| Mobile | Opening one closes the other (space constraint) |

**Rationale for hidden by default:**
1. Keeps UI clean and approachable for beginners
2. Most casual users won't adjust velocity per-step
3. Power users will find the toggle
4. Mobile especially benefits from reduced vertical space
5. Consistent with ChromaticGrid (also hidden until expanded)

**Draw mode:**
- Drag across to "draw" velocity curve
- Click individual bar to adjust single step
- Shift+drag for fine adjustment

**Polyrhythm behavior:**

Each track's velocity lane is **proportional to its step count**.

| Track | Step Count | Velocity Bars |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Kick | 16 | 16 bars |
| Hi-hat | 5 | 5 bars |
| Melody | 32 | 32 bars |

No fake repetition, no empty space. A 5-step track has exactly 5 velocity bars aligned with its 5 steps.

**Implementation:**
- Velocity lane component below step row
- Updates p-lock volume on drag
- Visual feedback: bar height changes in real-time
- Only shows bars for active steps (inactive steps have no velocity)

### Scrolling Track List with Fixed Actions

The track list should be a scrolling window so that copy/paste/delete are always visible.

**Why:** With many tracks, action buttons scroll off screen. User has to scroll back to find them.

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Track controls (left) | Fixed/sticky |
| Steps (center) | Horizontal scroll (existing) |
| Actions (right) | Fixed/sticky |

**Implementation:**
- CSS `position: sticky` on action column
- Or move actions to track header row
- Ensure actions visible regardless of scroll position

---

## 30H: Discoverability

### Tooltips on All Interactive Elements

Hover to learn what controls do.

**Why:** Currently users have to guess or discover by accident. Especially important for new features (rotate, invert, Euclidean).

| Element | Tooltip |
|---------|---------|
| M button | "Mute track" |
| S button | "Solo track" |
| Track name | "Click to preview, double-click to rename" |
| Unmute All | "Unmute all tracks (⌘⇧M)" |
| Transpose | "Shift pitch by semitones" |
| Rotate ← | "Shift pattern left (wrap)" |
| Rotate → | "Shift pattern right (wrap)" |
| Invert | "Toggle all steps on/off" |
| Euclidean slider | "Euclidean rhythm: distribute hits evenly" |
| Step cell | "Click to toggle, drag to paint, right-click for p-lock" |

**Implementation:**
- Native `title` attribute for simple cases
- Custom tooltip component for rich content (keyboard shortcuts)
- Delay: 500ms before showing
- Touch: long-press shows tooltip, or skip entirely

**Keyboard shortcut hints:**
- Tooltips include shortcut when available
- "Mute track (M)" or "Play/Pause (Space)"

## 30I: Track Drawer & Mixer Panel

### Design Philosophy

Track controls fall into two categories:

| Category | Controls | Access Pattern |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Frequent** | Mute, Solo, Steps | Every few seconds |
| **Occasional** | Volume, Transpose, Swing, Mode, Pattern tools | Every few minutes |

Frequent controls stay visible in the track row. Occasional controls live in the **Track Drawer** — revealed on demand.

### Track Row (Collapsed — Default View)

The collapsed track row prioritizes step entry:

**Mobile: Bottom Sheet with Chips**

On mobile, tapping the step count opens a bottom sheet with chip-style buttons:

**Category Definitions:**

| Category | Values | Musical Purpose |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Standard** | 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 | Powers of 2 — standard 4/4 bar divisions |
| **Triplet** | 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 | Multiples of 3 — shuffle, swing, 12/8 feels |
| **Polyrhythmic** | 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 27, 28, 36 | Cross-rhythms, odd meters, phasing |

**Value Labels (Desktop):**

| Value | Label | Explanation |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | quarter-bar | 1/4 of standard 16-step bar |
| 8 | half-bar | Half of standard bar |
| 16 | one bar | Standard bar length |
| 32 | two bars | Extended phrase |
| 64 | four bars | Long phrase |
| 128 | eight bars | Maximum length |
| 3 | triplet pulse | Basic triplet |
| 6 | half-triplet | Half bar in triplet feel |
| 12 | triplet bar | Full bar of triplets |
| 24 | trap hi-hats | Fast triplet subdivision (genre-specific) |
| 48 | 3-bar triplet | Extended triplet phrase |
| 96 | 6-bar triplet | Long triplet phrase |
| 5 | quintuplet ● | 5 against 4 — prime, complex polyrhythm |
| 7 | septuplet ● | 7 against 4 — Balkan, complex |
| 9 | nonaplet | 9 = 3² — extended triplet feel |
| 10 | 5:4 base | 5×2 — double quintuplet |
| 11 | prime ● | Prime — maximally complex |
| 13 | prime ● | Prime — maximally complex |
| 14 | 7×2 | Double septuplet |

**The ● Indicator:**

The ● marks **prime numbers** (5, 7, 11, 13). These create the most complex polyrhythms because they share no common factors with standard step counts:

| Prime | Against 16 | Cycle Before Repeat |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| 5 | 5:16 | 80 steps |
| 7 | 7:16 | 112 steps |
| 11 | 11:16 | 176 steps |
| 13 | 13:16 | 208 steps |

**Interaction:**

| Platform | Trigger | Behavior |

## Polyrhythm Considerations

Keyboardia supports per-track step counts (3, 4, 5, 6, 7... up to 128). Each track loops independently. This affects several Phase 30 features.

### Summary Table

| Feature | Polyrhythm Impact | Resolution |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Progress bar | Which track to reference? | Use longest track; individual looping shown via step highlighting |
| Loop selection | What are "bars" for odd counts? | Use steps, not bars; global range applies to all tracks |
| Velocity lane | Width mismatch between tracks | Proportional to each track's step count |
| Multi-select | Cross-track selection | Bounded by each track's step count |
| Pattern ops | None | Operate on individual tracks independently |
| Euclidean | Perfect fit | Algorithm works for any step count |
| Per-track swing | Odd step counts | Modulo 2 works; creates interesting asymmetric patterns |
| Track reorder | None | Independent of step count |

### Per-Track Swing with Odd Step Counts

Swing affects "every other step" — this works for any step count via modulo 2.

| Step Count | On-beat steps | Off-beat (swung) steps |
|------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 16 | 1, 3, 5, 7... | 2, 4, 6, 8... |
| 5 | 1, 3, 5 | 2, 4 |
| 3 | 1, 3 | 2 |
| 7 | 1, 3, 5, 7 | 2, 4, 6 |

Odd step counts create asymmetric swing patterns, which is musically interesting (feature, not bug). A 5-step track with swing has a different groove character than an 8-step track.

### Euclidean Rhythms + Polyrhythms

Euclidean rhythms are *ideal* for polyrhythmic exploration:

| Track 1 | Track 2 | Combined Feel |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| E(3, 8) | E(5, 8) | Interlocking 8th notes |
| E(3, 5) | E(4, 7) | True polyrhythm (35-step cycle) |
| E(7, 12) | E(5, 12) | West African 12/8 feel |

The algorithm works for any step count, making it a perfect tool for polyrhythmic composition.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Progress bar position | Above grid | Doesn't interfere with step interaction |
| Category colors | Left border | Subtle, scannable, doesn't compete with step colors |
| Rotate vs shift | Rotate (wrap) | More musical, preserves pattern density |
| Random density | Preset options | Simpler than slider, covers common use cases |
| Rename trigger | Double-click | Standard UI pattern, doesn't conflict with single-click |
| Drag-to-paint state | First click determines | Prevents accidental toggle oscillation |
| Velocity lane | Collapsible | Keeps UI clean when not needed |
| Loop region | Timeline ruler | Familiar from DAWs, combines with progress bar |
| Track reorder | Drag handle | Explicit affordance, prevents accidental drag |
| Euclidean UI | Slider | Immediate visual feedback, intuitive |
| Tooltip delay | 500ms | Avoids flicker, standard UX convention |

## Primary Action Button Pattern

Every screen in Keyboardia has exactly **one primary action** — the thing the user most likely wants to do next. This button receives elevated visual treatment to guide attention without animation.

### The Pattern

```
Secondary buttons:                    Primary action:
┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐            ╔══════════════╗
│  Share   │ │  Delete  │            ║    Remix     ║
└──────────┘ └──────────┘            ╚══════════════╝
   flat         flat                    elevated
   1px border   1px border              2px accent border
   no shadow    no shadow               soft glow shadow
                                        1.02× scale
```

### Visual Treatment

| Property | Secondary Button | Primary Action |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Border | 1px `--border` | 2px `--accent` |
| Shadow | None | `0 2px 8px rgba(accent, 0.15)` |
| Scale | 1.0 | 1.02 |
| Background | `--surface` | `--surface` (or subtle accent tint) |
| Text weight | Normal | Medium or Semi-bold |

**CSS:**

```css
.button {
  background: var(--surface);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: var(--radius);
}

.button--primary {
  border: 2px solid var(--accent);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(var(--accent-rgb), 0.15);
  transform: scale(1.02);
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

### Primary Action Per Screen

| Screen / Context | Primary Action | Why |
|------------------|----------------|-----|
| **Published session** | Remix | Convert viewer to creator |
| **Editor (empty)** | Add Track | Only logical next step |
| **Editor (has tracks, stopped)** | Play | User wants to hear their work |
| **Editor (playing)** | Play (still) | Play remains primary; Stop is secondary |
| **Mixer panel** | Back to Pattern | Return to main workflow |
| **Track drawer** | None | Drawer is auxiliary; no single primary |
| **Settings/Preferences** | Save / Done | Confirm and exit |

Note: The **SamplePicker** ("Add Track" panel) is part of the editor view, not a separate screen. When visible, instrument buttons act as the call-to-action — no separate primary button needed.

### Published Session: Remix Button

When viewing someone else's published session, the **Remix** button is the primary action:

**Why Remix is primary:**
- User has just listened to something inspiring
- Natural next thought: "I want to try my own version"
- Converts passive viewer → active creator
- Key growth mechanism (remixes create new content)

### Implications

#### 1. Only One Primary Per View

A screen cannot have multiple primary actions. If you're tempted to elevate two buttons, you haven't decided what the screen is *for*.

```
❌ Wrong (competing primaries):
╔══════════╗  ╔══════════╗
║   Save   ║  ║  Share   ║
╚══════════╝  ╚══════════╝

✅ Right (clear hierarchy):
╔══════════╗  ┌──────────┐
║   Save   ║  │  Share   │
╚══════════╝  └──────────┘
   primary     secondary
```

#### 2. Secondary Buttons Must Recede

If the primary action is elevated, secondaries must be visually quieter. Otherwise the elevation has no effect.

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Primary | Elevated (accent border, shadow, slight scale) |
| Secondary | Flat (subtle border, no shadow) |
| Tertiary / Destructive | Text-only or muted color |

#### 3. Primary Can Change With State

The primary action may change based on context:

| State | Primary Action |
|-------|----------------|
| Empty pattern | Add Track |
| Pattern with tracks | Play |
| Pattern playing | Play (or arguably none — let user focus on listening) |

**Implementation:**

```typescript
function getPrimaryAction(state: AppState): string | null {
  if (state.view === 'published-session') return 'remix';
  if (state.view === 'mixer') return 'back-to-pattern';
  if (state.tracks.length === 0) return 'add-track';
  return 'play';
}
```

#### 4. Mobile: Same Position, Same Elevation

On mobile, the primary action stays in its current position — no floating action buttons. The elevated visual treatment (accent border, shadow) applies consistently across screen sizes.

#### 5. Accessibility Benefits

This pattern works for users with motion sensitivity:

| Approach | Motion Required | Works for Everyone |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Animated pulse | Yes | ❌ Needs fallback |
| Shimmer effect | Yes | ❌ Needs fallback |
| **Elevated resting state** | **No** | ✅ Universal |

The elevated state communicates importance through **static visual hierarchy**, not animation.

#### 6. No Animation Needed

Unlike attention-grabbing animations (pulse, glow, shimmer), the elevated state:
- Is always visible (not time-dependent)
- Doesn't fatigue the user
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` automatically
- Works in screenshots and static documentation

### Design Tokens

Add to the design system:

```css
:root {
  /* Primary action elevation */
  --button-primary-border-width: 2px;
  --button-primary-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(var(--accent-rgb), 0.15);
  --button-primary-scale: 1.02;

  /* Secondary button (receded) */
  --button-secondary-border-width: 1px;
  --button-secondary-shadow: none;
  --button-secondary-scale: 1;
}
```

## Testing & Implementation Strategy

### Known Bug Patterns to Watch

Based on analysis of features, these are the likely bug categories:

| Pattern | Risk Features | Prevention |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Race conditions** | Drag-to-paint + multiplayer sync | Debounce paint events, batch multiplayer messages |
| **State desync** | Loop region, selection, drawer open | Single source of truth in reducer |
| **Touch/mouse conflicts** | Drag-to-paint, velocity lane drawing | Use `pointer` events, test on real devices |
| **Animation jank** | Progress bar, drawer expand, metronome pulse | CSS transforms only, avoid layout thrash |
| **Click disambiguation** | Preview (click) vs rename (double-click) | 200ms timer pattern, clear state machine |
| **Modifier key conflicts** | Shift+click (p-lock vs multi-select) | **CRITICAL: Resolve before implementing** |
| **Undo/redo gaps** | Pattern ops, bulk selection ops | Add to action history, test roundtrip |
| **Overflow** | Long track names, many tracks, extreme step counts | Truncation, scroll, limits |

### Modifier Key Conflict Resolution

**Problem:** Shift+Click is currently used for p-lock (Phase 24) and proposed for multi-select extension.

**Solution: State-Dependent Shift+Click**

Shift+Click behavior depends on whether a selection exists:

| State | Shift+Click Does | Rationale |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| No selection | Opens p-lock menu | **Backward compatible** — existing users unchanged |
| Selection exists | Extends selection to clicked step | Standard multi-select behavior |

**Complete gesture table:**

| Gesture | Desktop | Touch | Action |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| Click | ✅ | ✅ | Toggle step |
| Drag | ✅ | ✅ | Paint steps |
| Ctrl/Cmd+Click | ✅ | — | Start/toggle selection (sets anchor) |
| Shift+Click (no selection) | ✅ | — | P-lock menu |
| Shift+Click (with selection) | ✅ | — | Extend selection from anchor |
| Right-click | ✅ | — | P-lock menu (always) |
| Long-press (500ms) | ✅ | ✅ | P-lock menu (always) |

**State machine:**

```
┌──────────────────┐
│   NO SELECTION   │ ◄─── Initial state
│                  │
│  Shift+Click =   │
│    P-LOCK ✓      │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         │ Ctrl/Cmd+Click (start selection)
         │ OR drag selection box
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│ SELECTION ACTIVE │
│                  │
│  Shift+Click =   │
│  EXTEND RANGE    │
│                  │
│  P-lock via:     │
│  • Right-click   │
│  • Long-press    │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         │ ESC, or click empty area,
         │ or deselect all steps
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│   NO SELECTION   │
└──────────────────┘
```

**Critical UX requirement: Unmissable selection state**

For state-dependent behavior to work, users must always know when selection is active:

| Visual Element | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **Selection badge** | Shows in transport bar: `░░ 3 selected (ESC) ░░` |
| **Selected steps** | Blue tint + thicker border |
| **Anchor step** | Corner marker (▲) showing extend-from point |
| **ESC hint** | Reminds users how to clear selection |

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [▶] BPM [120]  Swing [50%]  ░░░░ 3 selected (ESC) ░░░░           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                    │
│   ●  ●  ○  ○ │ ●̲ ̲ ̲●̲ ̲ ̲●̲ ̲ ̲●̲  │ ○  ○  ○  ○      steps 5-8 selected  │
│              │ ▲  ─────│                    anchor at step 5      │
│                                                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface SelectionState {
  selected: Set<string>;      // Set of stepIds
  anchor: string | null;      // Starting point for Shift+Click extend
}

function handleStepPointerDown(step: Step, event: React.PointerEvent) {
  const hasSelection = selection.selected.size > 0;

  if (event.shiftKey) {
    if (hasSelection && selection.anchor) {
      // EXTEND selection from anchor to this step
      extendSelection(selection.anchor, step.id);
    } else {
      // NO selection: open p-lock (backward compatible)
      openPLockMenu(step);
    }
    return;
  }

  if (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) {
    // Toggle in selection, set as anchor
    toggleInSelection(step.id);
    setAnchor(step.id);
    return;
  }

  // Plain click: toggle step, clear selection
  toggleStep(step);
  clearSelection();
}
```

**Edge cases:**

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Shift+Click with no selection | P-lock (backward compatible) |
| Shift+Click with selection | Extend selection |
| Want p-lock while selection exists | Right-click or long-press |
| Click (no modifier) with selection | Clears selection, toggles step |
| ESC key | Clears selection |
| Ctrl+Click on only selected step | Deselects, returns to no-selection state |

**Risk mitigation:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| User forgets selection exists | Persistent selection badge with count |
| Surprise extend instead of p-lock | Badge always visible, ESC hint shown |
| Can't access p-lock when selected | Right-click/long-press always work |

### Recommended Phase Split

The audit identified that 24 features is 3-5x larger than typical phases. Recommended split:

#### Phase 30A: Core Interactions (MVP)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Drag-to-paint | Core UX improvement, 5x faster step entry |
| Track Drawer | Foundation for all track controls |
| Per-track Volume | Essential mixing |
| Progress bar | Visual grounding |
| Category colors | Low effort, high visual impact |
| Tooltips | Discoverability |

**Success criteria:** Step entry is dramatically faster. Volumes are adjustable. UI feels more polished.

#### Phase 30B: Pattern Tools

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Rotate pattern | Quick variation |
| Invert pattern | Quick variation |
| Reverse pattern | Quick variation |
| Euclidean rhythms | Creative tool |
| Per-track swing | Musical flexibility |
| Per-track transpose | In drawer, simple addition |

**Success criteria:** Users can quickly create pattern variations without manual step editing.

#### Phase 30C: Mixing & Selection

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Mixer panel | All volumes visible |
| Velocity lane | Dynamics sculpting |
| Multi-select | Bulk operations |
| Loop selection | Essential for long patterns |

**Success criteria:** Users can mix tracks efficiently. Bulk editing works.

#### Phase 30D: Polish

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Track reorder | Expected feature |
| Track rename | Convenience |
| Click to preview | Sound identification |
| Unmute All | Workflow shortcut |
| Metronome pulse | Visual tempo feedback |
| Scrolling track list | UX fix |

**Success criteria:** All rough edges smoothed. Professional feel.

---

### Features Recommended for Removal

Based on value/effort analysis:

| Feature | Reason to Remove |
|---------|------------------|
| Play button hover fill | Low impact, adds visual noise |
| Dim unused beats | Minor visual tweak, debatable benefit |

These can be re-evaluated if users request them.

**Note:** Random fill was removed from this spec. Mirror pattern is retained — creates musically useful ABCDCBA symmetry patterns.

---

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests

| Component | Test Cases |
|-----------|------------|
| Euclidean algorithm | Known patterns (tresillo, cinquillo), edge cases (0 hits, N=steps) |
| Pattern ops | Rotate, invert, reverse on various step counts |
| Selection logic | Range selection, toggle, extend, cross-track |
| Swing calculation | Even/odd step counts, combined with global swing |

#### Integration Tests

| Scenario | Verification |
|----------|--------------|
| Drag-to-paint + undo | Batch paint undoes in single step |
| Multi-select + p-lock | Apply to all selected |
| Track drawer + multiplayer | State syncs correctly |
| Loop region + polyrhythm | All tracks respect global range |
| Mixer panel + track drawer | Volume changes reflect in both |

#### E2E Tests

| Flow | Steps |
|------|-------|
| Pattern creation | Load → add tracks → drag-to-paint → play → hear result |
| Mix session | Add tracks → open mixer → adjust volumes → close mixer → verify |
| Loop workflow | Set loop → play → verify playhead bounces → clear loop |
| Rename track | Double-click → type → blur → verify persists |

#### Performance Tests

| Metric | Target | Test Method |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Drag-to-paint latency | <16ms | FPS counter during paint |
| Progress bar smoothness | 60fps | Visual inspection + profiler |
| Drawer animation | <200ms, no jank | Timeline profiler |
| Selection with 64 tracks × 32 steps | No lag | Stress test |

#### Accessibility Tests

| Feature | A11y Requirement |
|---------|------------------|
| All animations | Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` |
| Tooltips | Keyboard accessible |
| Drag-to-paint | Keyboard alternative (arrow keys + space) |
| Track drawer | Focus management on open/close |
| Mixer panel | Screen reader announces volume changes |

---

### Edge Cases to Define

#### Euclidean Rhythms

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| 0 hits | Clear all steps |
| hits = steps | Fill all steps |
| hits > steps | Clamp to steps |
| Slider while playing | Live update (debounced) |

#### Loop Selection

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Loop start > end | Swap values |
| Loop = 1 step | Play single step repeatedly |
| Loop beyond longest track | Clamp to longest track length |
| Delete while looping | Clear loop if region becomes invalid |

#### Mirror Pattern

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Odd step count | Center step stays, mirrors around it |
| 1-2 steps | No-op (too short to mirror) |
| Empty pattern | No-op |

#### Multi-Select

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Select across tracks | Independent selection per track |
| Select beyond track length | Ignore steps beyond track's stepCount |
| Delete with selection | Clear selected steps, keep others |
| Copy/paste across tracks | Paste to same relative positions |

---

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Shift+Click surprise (extend vs p-lock) | Medium | Medium | State-dependent behavior + unmissable selection badge + right-click fallback |
| Drag-to-paint desync in multiplayer | Medium | Medium | Batch messages, reconcile on mouse up |
| Velocity lane performance with 128 steps | Medium | Medium | Virtualization, canvas rendering |
| Drawer animation jank on low-end devices | Medium | Low | CSS-only transforms, test on slow devices |
| Touch drag conflicts with scroll | Medium | Medium | Explicit drag handle, test on tablets |
