### Step Count Options

| Steps | Bars | Loops/Bar | Use Case |
|-------|------|-----------|----------|
| **4** | 0.25 | 4× | Four-on-the-floor kick, pulse patterns, motorik beat |
| **8** | 0.5 | 2× | Half-bar phrases, 8th-note arpeggios, call-response |
| 16 | 1 | 1× | Standard patterns (drums, bass) |
| 32 | 2 | 0.5× | Basslines with variation, 2-bar melodies |
| 64 | 4 | 0.25× | Long melodies, chord progressions, evolving patterns |

### Polyrhythmic Combinations

| Combo | Resolution | Musical Style |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| 4 vs 16 | 1 bar | Pulse under complex melody (minimal techno) |
| 4 vs 32 | 2 bars | Hypnotic repetition (Berlin minimal) |
| 8 vs 16 | 1 bar | Half-time feel (boom-bap, lo-fi) |
| 8 vs 12 | 1.5 bars | Afrobeat / West African clave |
| 4 vs 8 vs 16 | 1 bar | Layered polyrhythm |

### Example Sessions

| Session | URL | Demonstrates |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Polyrhythm Demo | `/s/cab63f7d-7aea-4e26-b990-2ce7d5d1401c` | 4/8/16/32 step combinations |
| Afrobeat Groove | `/s/4c889c91-1c43-4c4a-ab8a-4a2bff3f50fd` | 4/8-step polyrhythms, tresillo pattern |

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Step count vs multipliers | Actual step count | Clearer mental model, all steps visible/editable |
| Loop behavior | Per-track independent | Polyrhythms emerge naturally |
| Visual approach | Inline scrolling | Direct manipulation, see all steps |
| Dark mode | #121212 not #000000 | Industry standard, reduces eye strain |
| Dropdown vs buttons | Dropdown | Scales to 5+ options, cleaner UI |
| Solo behavior | Solo wins over mute | Industry standard (Ableton, Logic, Pro Tools) |
| No exclusive solo | Explicit un-solo | Consistent modifier semantics (Shift = disclose) |

---

## Phase 5: Sharing UI Polish ✅

**Goal:** Complete the sharing model with clear terminology and remix lineage visibility

### Completed

- [x] Rename "Share" button to "Invite"
- [x] Add "Send Copy" button (creates remix, copies URL, stays on current session)
- [x] Add `lastAccessedAt` field to session model (for orphan detection)
- [x] Add `remixCount` field to session model
- [x] Add `remixedFromName` field to session model
- [x] Display remix lineage in session header ("Remixed from X")
- [x] Show remix count as social proof
- [x] Add orphan banner for sessions inactive 90+ days
- [x] Backwards compatibility for existing sessions

### Session Creation

All new sessions start empty (no tracks, default tempo 120 BPM, swing 0%):
- **Home page** (`/`): Automatically creates empty session and redirects to `/s/{uuid}`
- **New button**: Creates empty session and navigates to it

### Button Actions

| Button | Action | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Invite** | Copy current session URL | Recipients join your live session |
| **Send Copy** | Create remix, copy that URL, stay here | Recipients get their own independent copy |
| **Remix** | Create remix, navigate to it | You work on a copy |
| **New** | Create empty session (no tracks, default tempo/swing), navigate to it | Fresh start |

---

## Phase 6: Observability ✅

  - Session state tracking (trackCount, hasData)
  - Stored in KV with 1-hour TTL for cost efficiency
- [x] Debug endpoints
  - `GET /api/debug/session/:id` — Inspect session state without modifying access time
  - `GET /api/debug/logs` — Query recent logs (supports `?sessionId=` and `?last=` filters)
- [x] Metrics endpoint
  - `GET /api/metrics` — System metrics (session counts, request counts by type)
  - Tracks: total sessions, created/accessed today, last 5 minutes activity
- [x] Client-side debug mode (`?debug=1`)
  - Debug overlay showing session ID and state
  - Real-time operation logging in UI
  - Quick links to debug API endpoints
  - Console logging of all session operations

- [x] Visual feedback for playing notes

### How It Works

1. **Synth tracks** show a ♪ button in the track controls
2. Click ♪ to **expand** the chromatic grid view
3. **Click any cell** at the intersection of pitch row and step column
4. Notes are placed using the existing parameter lock system

> **Lessons Learned:** See [PHASE-13B-LESSONS.md](./research/PHASE-13B-LESSONS.md)

### Critical Issues Fixed

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Race condition in useSession.ts | State machine: `idle` → `loading` → `applying` → `ready` |
| WebSocket message ordering | Client/server sequence numbers |
| Missing Error Boundary | React Error Boundary with recovery UI |

### High Priority Issues Fixed

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Memory leak in RemoteChangeContext | Track timers in Set, clear in cleanup |
| Audio volume reset timers | Added `pendingTimers` Set with cleanup on `stop()` |
| Missing null check | Defensive null checks with fallback |
| Race condition in useMultiplayer | Cancellation flag pattern |
| Unbounded message queue | Priority queue: `high` > `normal` > `low` |

### Medium Priority Issues Fixed

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Inconsistent constants | Aligned server to client bounds + parity tests |
| Missing error handling in audio decode | try/catch with meaningful error messages |
| Scheduler timing drift | Multiplicative timing: `startTime + (stepCount * duration)` |
| Missing mic cleanup | `releaseMicAccess()` stops MediaStream tracks |

### Documentation Created

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [PHASE-13B-LESSONS.md](./research/PHASE-13B-LESSONS.md) | Patterns, anti-patterns, key takeaways |
| [DURABLE-OBJECTS-TESTING.md](./research/DURABLE-OBJECTS-TESTING.md) | Comprehensive DO testing guide |
| [REACT-BEST-PRACTICES.md](./research/REACT-BEST-PRACTICES.md) | React patterns for real-time collaborative apps |

### Key Patterns Documented

1. **State machines > boolean flags** for async operations
2. **Track all timers** in a Set for reliable cleanup
3. **Use cancellation flags** in useEffect to prevent stale callbacks
4. **Multiplicative timing** prevents drift in schedulers
5. **Priority queues** protect critical messages
6. **Parity tests** catch constant drift between modules
7. **Always catch** external API errors with meaningful messages
8. **Release resources** (MediaStream tracks, WebSockets) explicitly
